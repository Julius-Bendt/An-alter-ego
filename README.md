# An Alter Ego

## Description:
An Alter Ego were devleop to participate in the danish championship in game development. The game made though to the finals, but didn't win any prices.
The game got me further in to game development though. It was developed in 2015, and were one of my first *real* games, meaning that I actually **kinda** finished it to a playable state. 

The game is an adventure type of game, where you can die x-times, before "heaven" breaks. You have to get into the city of ansaldo, to kill a *man*.

As in the other repositories in "dead projects", this project is, as the name suggests, dead. I wont be updating or maintaining it.
The code in the project does not follow my current style of coding, or up to any standards.
the code is in other words, spaghetti code and properly filled with bugs. 


## Setup:
clone the reposity.<br>
The latest unity version tested: UNITY_2019.4.11f1<br>
However, newer version *should* work. 

## Running:
Check that the program is not corrupt or tampered with by using the the below checksums:
